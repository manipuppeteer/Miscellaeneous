A combination of some miscellaneous projects that I did which do not fit anywhere else -

- **Regresssion_sales** is a simple multiple regression model to **Advertising medium vs Sales** data, the **statsmodels** package is used and all the statistical diagnostics intensively scrutinized.
- **Visualization.ipynb** is simply a combination of my attempts to make aesthetic, informative, and self-contained plots using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**. This is still ongoing
